# Energy Web Innovation Challenge Proposal
* **Project Name**: Gemini Gem Solar Pollinators
* **Project Proposer GitHub**: https://github.com/Gemini Gem Solar Pollinators
* **Energy Web Chain Payment Address**: 0xe61D7Ea53Dc18595367F881ceA1f74C8A13C7675

## Project Description
The huge solar farms being created in Nevada can provide opportunities to explain how solar works, why it helps Nevada's RPS (renewable portfolio standard), reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and reduce our air pollution.  These concepts can be communicated in an interesting, lively environment that will inspire the imagination for all citizens in Nevada and more.  

Nevada has progressively passed legislation to move our RPS from 25% to 50% by 2030.  We will see more and continued development of solar farms in our surrounding BLM (Bureau of Land Management) land.  

With partnerships with the energy investment companies we can arrange the layout and design of these solar arrays to create an inviting, interesting center for STEAM projects.

A couple of the specific items we would look to establish are:
-Create a multidimensional and cross-disciplinary STEAM concept into sustainability and community engagement
-Design of the solar array creating an accessible community and educational space.
-Establishing a pollinator-friendly solar scorecards for Southern Nevada.
-Setup the use of the modeling tool InVEST(Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs) to augment natural resource management.
-Partnerships with local environmental organizations to incorporate Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to bring the generation of climate change into direct involvement.


## Team
* **Members**: Pam Stuckey, CEO and Suzy Martinez, CMO Renewable Envoy
* **Code Repositories**: https://github.com/_alice, https://github.com/_pam
* **Website**: http://renewableenvoy.com
* **Team's Experience**:
Renewable Envoy therefore operates under a dual-business model: as a project management firm to assist small, independent, and unincorporated artists complete and compete for Clark County art and infrastructure RFQs and RFPs, and as a consultant and project manager for larger organizations seeking to prepare and manage a budget allocation application to access C-PACE funds in Las Vegas. 

For artists, we handle RFQ and RFP proposal preparation (including verification of ownership, business license permits, insurance documents and prior project qualifications), while also setting up an accounting system to track expenditures post-bid award. 

 For organizations, Renewable Envoy offers C-PACE Project Management and Application Preparation Services. For select clients, we also offer consulting services on renewable energy policy in the valley. Navigating the complexities of tax codes and funding bodies can be daunting, but our years of experience equips us to provide the best insight. 

## Development Roadmap

### Milestone 1
* Estimated Duration: 4 weeks
Design of the solar array creating an accessible community and educational space

### Milestone 2
* Estimated Duration: 4 weeks
Establishing a pollinator-friendly solar scorecards for Southern Nevada

# Additional Information
InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs) is a suite of free, open-source software models used to map and value the goods and services from nature that sustain and fulfill human life.  Out of Stanford university this modeling tool uses data about the environment to explore how changes in ecosystems are likely to affect the flow of benefits to people. It is designed to inform decisions about natural resource management.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a technological field that incorporates geographical features with tabular data in order to map, analyze, and assess real-world problems. The IoT for Nevadaâ€™s future, to identify, prioritize, and select conservation locations supporting bees.
 
We will seek to form partnerships with magnet high schools, environmental organizations and the Nevada Museum of Arts 'The Center for Art + Environment' for curriculum.
